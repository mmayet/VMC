                        <strong>How Can I?</strong>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><em>Written after getting musalsal ḥadīth of shaking hands and interlocking hands</em></p>
                        <p>How can I wash my hand that has touched you ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, raising my hands, asking that I see you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My mouth that utters your sweet concise speech ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, dreaming of the day I get to speak to you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My nose that breathes the same air you breathed ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, imagining the day I get to smell you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My face that smiles at the mention of your blessed name ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, gitty over the day I get to be kissed by you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My arm that grazes by your perfect grave ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, longing for the day I get to be hugged by you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My head that can't stop thinking about you ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, awaiting the day I will be thought about by you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> My ears that hear your gentle words and beautiful praises ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, yearning for the day I get to hear you ﷺ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> And my feet that tread the same earth you tread ﷺ?
                            <br/> But I do, as I live my life running to meet you ﷺ.

                            <br/> You take my heart away,
                            <br/> And teach me how to feel.
                            <br/> How to live my life,
                            <br/> And get to God's light.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> Your way is true,
                            <br/> This world is a lie,
                            <br/> Your life is a standard
                            <br/> And the Lord testified.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> Your worship— perfect and serene
                            <br/> Divinely crafted as a model to be seen
                            <br/> Your eyes would tear, and your feet would swell
                            <br/> Crying for us, that we don't go to Hell
                            <br/> How can I thank you, I can't do enough
                            <br/> So I ask God to bless you, and in Him I put my trust.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> Yā Qamarūn, Yā Jamīl,
                            <br/> You take my heart away,
                            <br/> And teach me how to feel.
                            <br/> How to live my life,
                            <br/> And get to God's light.

                        <strong>You ﷺ Are</strong>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            Is your radiance like a lamp ﷺ?
                            <br/> Or the sun?
                            <br/> Your face, the moon— the full moon ﷺ?
                            <br/> Your neck, a statue of pure silver ﷺ?
                            <br/> Your skin, silk ﷺ?
                            <br/> Or rose petals?
                            <br/> Or brocade?
                            <br/> Your words, threaded pearls ﷺ?
                            <br/> Your teeth, hailstones ﷺ?
                            <br/> Or a flash of lighting?
                            <br/> Your sweat, musk ﷺ?
                            <br/> Your sweat, pearls ﷺ?
                            <br/> Your very being, light upon light, ﷺ?
                            <br/>
                            <br/> How can you, ﷺ, be compared to such creations, when you, ﷺ, are— no doubt— greater than them all?
                            <br/>
                            <br/> Saying the sun is a reflection of you, ﷺ, makes more sense;
                            <br/> That the grains of sand of Madīnah shine because of you, ﷺ, makes more sense.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> When you, ﷺ, are God ﷻ's Beloved;
                            <br/> His ﷻ's Chosen One;
                            <br/> His ﷻ's Selected One;
                            <br/> His ﷻ's Pleasing One;
                            <br/> How can you, ﷺ, be compared to other mere creation?
                            <br/>
                            <br/> God ﷻ has made the earth pure for you ﷺ;
                            <br/> God ﷻ has forgiven your past and future ﷺ;
                            <br/> God ﷻ has given you al-Kawthar, ﷺ;
                            <br/> God ﷻ has given you Intercession, ﷺ;
                            <br/> God ﷻ has placed your name, ﷺ, with His, ﷻ.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> You, ﷺ, are the best of creation.
                            <br/> Better than land;
                            <br/> Better than sea;
                            <br/> Better than the skies;
                            <br/> Better than the planets;
                            <br/> Better than the stars;
                            <br/> Better than Madīnah;
                            <br/> Better than Makkah;
                            <br/> Better than The Kaʿbah;
                            <br/> Better than The Universe;
                            <br/> Better than Jannah;
                            <br/> Better than The Angels;
                            <br/> Better than Jibrīl;
                            <br/> Better than The Very Throne of The Almighty God, ﷻ;
                            <br/>
                            <br/> —You, ﷺ, are: The Greatest Creation Of God, ﷻ.
